# ML-Project-Product-Recommendation-System-
In this ML project, I have used feature extraction by vectorization to build a recommender system that recommends fashion products. After basic EDA and FE, I created a new feature that combines all important columns for recommendation. Then I applied count vectorization and cosine similarity. Finally, I wrote a code for the recommendation system.
